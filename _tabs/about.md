This blog is meant to be a guide on how to securely setup it infrastructure. This is just my homelab so there is not the biggest of test cases and user impact to take into consideration. 

I have an interest in IT and IT security, i work with it as well. This is not a reflection on my job, just showcasing my interests

If you should have inquries or questiones feel free to reach out to me on mith@labify.dk
